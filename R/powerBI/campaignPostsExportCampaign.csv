Solar panels line the rooftops of schools and libraries. EV charging stations stand ready in grocery store parking lots. Electric buses and service vehicles are rolling out to replace diesel fleets. 

Behind every project is a story, and every story has to start somewhere: a conversation, a calculation, a leap of faith. These projects come to life through the persistence and creativity of individuals and teams determined to build a cleaner future. 

RMI's new ‘Voices of Clean Energy’ shares these stories. Each profile highlights the people turning ideas into action: grant writers, project managers, engineers, community leaders, and more. Each story captures the technical expertise, community ties, and determination that helps our nation’s energy systems progress. 

By elevating these voices, we honor the individuals building a healthier energy landscape — and invite others to join in.

This means that emissions intensity – the level of emissions per barrel of oil or gas — can vary wildly depending on those processes. We also can’t forget super-heating methane, which can leak at any one (or all) of these steps. 

This difference in intensity can have profound impacts on energy security and public safety, but has largely been hidden from markets, regulators, and citizens for decades. 

RMI’s free interactive Oil Climate Index plus Gas (OCI+) tool reveals life-cycle emissions, highlights areas to prevent energy waste, and shares strategies so that industry, policymakers, investors, and researchers can take action to tackle methane leaks. The latest update of OCI+ also includes satellite observation data from @carbonmapper’s Tanager-1 and other point source satellites to combine detected methane measurements with modeled estimates. 

OCI+ underscores the critical role of targeted, resource-specific strategies to reduce energy waste, cut oil and gas emissions, and make the benefits of reducing emissions more transparent for decision-makers.

Motivated by these and other benefits of advanced energy systems, communities and states across America, as well as  most countries globally, are speeding the shift. 

US renewable power output has risen sharply since 2000, driven by a combination of falling costs and supportive policies. While related federal incentives have fluctuated, state-level policies have remained steadier. Early embrace of renewables by community leaders, businesses, and elected leaders, combined with states’ economic development efforts, have laid a durable foundation. 

And as homeowners, cities, and countries reckon with rising costs due to damage amplified by climate change — such as homes lost to wildfire, flash floods from unprecedented deluges, and crops lost to drought — cutting emissions remains a top priority, along with improving energy accessibility, reliability, and affordability.

 ⚡ Renewables that reduce reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports
 💸 Solar + storage that are now cheaper than coal
🔋 Self-sufficiency in solar, wind, and battery manufacturing 
🏭 Opportunities to build right the first time — growing 3x for steel, 3x for car travel, and 9x for air conditioners with clean and efficient solutions.

But why does methane leak, when are companies not aware, how can we spot it, and how can we fix the problem? 

Methane leaks from many different places, including faulty equipment, pressure changes underground, and from old, barely-producing marginal and abandoned wells. While some of these leaks are small, others can be huge causing a whopping 66 percent of the gas produced to be thrown away. The good news is that solutions, like equipment replacement, routine monitoring, open certification, and buyers' prioritizing the procurement of low-leakage gas, can stop leakage and cut methane waste. 

At #CERAWeek, energy solutions across the board were discussed, including how oil and gas can aid in the energy transition.

In the new year, there are still more opportunities to transform the energy system, save money, and cut climate pollution: 

➡️ Improving energy efficiency could save trillions of dollars while helping to manage electricity load growth.  

➡️ Slashing methane emissions will be key for tackling climate pollution. New satellites and commitments have made methane more visible, and now it’s time to act.  

➡️ Investments and financing need a reallocation — from fossil fuel subsidies to clean energy solutions. 

We are halfway through this decisive decade and the energy transition has thankfully come a long way.

As new clean technologies achieve S-curve growth, the incumbent technologies retreat along an inverse path, creating an X pattern that is a hallmark of technology evolution. 

Just as cars pushed out horses as the dominant mode of transportation, innovative technologies are transforming the energy system: 

Solar and wind are taking over the electricity supply as they continue to get cheaper, pushing out fossil-fueled electricity. 

Electricity is the new dominant energy carrier, transcending the inefficiencies and pollution from burning fossil fuel molecules. 

Efficient renewable electrification is removing wasteful combustion from the energy system.

The webinar underscored the importance of inclusive leadership in creating clean energy solutions, emphasizing that diverse perspectives are essential for sound decision-making and effective climate action. Despite the different geographies represented in the panel, “there are so many common threads in our paths”, noted Nitisha Agrawal, founder of the Smokeless Cookstove Foundation in India. “Forums like these establish community and a common shared hope and vision. Our problems, our solutions, are not so different from women in other regions.”  

The discussions highlighted the experiences and stories of women energy leaders advancing renewable energy projects in their countries, and the importance of capacity building and mentorship programs to support career growth. “Great opportunities are not out of reach, as long as they are visible to us,” panelist TeAnn Thomas added, “as the climate space is still evolving, there’s always new opportunities to explore and each of us has a role to play in making these visible for the next generation of energy leaders.” TeAnn spoke from experience, as she is an alumnus of both the ETA Global Caribbean Fellowship Program and the WIRE Network.  

Joining RMI’s Amber Zirnhelt and Valentina Guido on the roundtable were Nitisha Agrawal, Smokeless Cookstove Foundation and Clean Cooking Mentorship Program hosted by SE4All, Clean Cooking Alliance and Global Women Network for the Energy Transition; Sauda Bobboi, Rural Electrification Agency, Nigeria and Africa Minigrids Project; Nnyeka Prescod, Climate Finance Access Network (CFAN); and TeAnn Thomas, Turks and Caicos Islands Government and WIRE.  

The webinar built on the vision of centering gender and women empowerment in the climate agenda at COP and globally, as well as on the momentum of the WIRE Network’s recent convening in Barbados, where women leaders came together to strategize on advancing sustainable energy solutions across the Caribbean. Watch the video to gain insights into their collaboration and impact.

The $125-million partnership between IDB Invest and Engie Energia Chile has established a model financial mechanism that links interest rate reductions to early coal plant retirement while also funding renewable development. 

The structure's efficacy has been validated through real results. Multiple generating units at the Tocopilla thermal facility have ceased operations ahead of their scheduled retirement date, while a 151-megawatt wind generation facility in Calama progresses toward commissioning.  

This successful implementation can be attributed to several critical enabling conditions: Chile's comprehensive policy framework supporting coal phase-out initiatives; definitive demand signals from industrial electricity consumers; strategic deployment of blended finance by development institutions; and the increasingly favorable economics of renewable energy generation. 

Chile’s progress extends beyond this deal. In 2019, they decided to phase out coal. At the time, the South American country had 28 coal-fired power plants. At #COP29 on Friday, Chilean Minister of Environment Maisa Rojas provided a status update on a panel moderated by RMI’s Brian O’Hanlon and hosted by Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA): Chile has closed 11 coal-fired power plants and there are 9 more available for closing or retrofitting by 2026.

And green hydrogen provides a viable pathway to achieve near-zero emissions in the ironmaking process.  

Globally, steel supply chains are dependent on key regions that supply iron ore. That’s why iron and steel are usually produced in the same integrated facilities, near access to cheap coal.  

When iron ore reserves are co-located with renewable energy resources, a higher value green hydrogen-based iron product can be produced. This presents the opportunity to physically separate the making of steel from the production of iron to establish Green Iron Corridors. The production of green iron can instead take place in areas with ample renewables, to make clean hydrogen. Transporting that green iron to existing steel centers can help steelmaking remain where demand is strong. 

At #COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, RMI brought together representatives from various geographies across the supply chain — iron ore miners, renewable energy, and hydrogen developers, financiers, and government officials — to explore the emerging production and trade dynamics for Green Iron Corridors and identify action items to make them a reality.

The maritime sector sits at the center of the global economy – more than 80% of world trade travels by sea – and is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many shipping companies are taking action to reduce their emissions, but it can be challenging to find customers willing to pay for the higher cost of clean shipping fuels.  

Katalist helps bridge this gap by separating the low-emissions product from its sustainability benefits and transferring them to another party through a registry, enabling customers to claim the environmental benefits of low-emissions transport without physically receiving it, while stimulating overall use of clean fuels.  

Freight customers willing to pay a green premium for low-emission transport services can reliably use Katalist to achieve their decarbonization goals. And ship operators using low-emission fuels can use it to access a broader market of freight customers willing to pay an environmental supplement. The registry will help drive investments in lower-emission fuels, boosting their cost-competitiveness and commercial availability.

With 70 electric buses already in operation as of 2024, Bermuda is reducing emissions and costs, bringing daily operations close to 100% electric.
 
The Bermuda Department of Public Transportation (DPT) has replaced a large portion of its aging diesel buses, providing high-quality transit service for the island. These 70 e-buses will save Bermuda over $400,000 in fuel costs annually, reduce CO₂ emissions by 1,200 tons (equivalent to 600 cars), and cut diesel fuel use by 800,000 liters (the same as 12 transatlantic flights). 🚍💨
 
As #COP29 calls for action across all sectors, a recent RMI report explores Bermuda’s e-bus initiative, detailing planning, implementation challenges, and the strategies DPT used to achieve success. It also provides valuable insights for transit electrification worldwide.

In RMI's latest report, we discuss how the Global South – which we define as Latin America, Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia – is tapping into their rich renewable resources for power in record amounts.

“If you’d asked me a month ago who was deploying renewables faster – the Global South or the Global North – I would have thought it safe to say the Global North,” says RMI’s Vikram Singh, senior principal in the Global South program, “but, in a new RMI report, we dive into the data and find a different and surprising reality: the Global South is scaling solar and wind faster than the Global North.”

As COP29 unfolds in Baku, RMI is set to push for transformative action on the world’s most pressing climate challenges. This year’s “finance COP” is a pivotal moment to prioritize the Global South with commitments to extend climate finance, reduce wasteful energy use, and slash methane emissions. Here’s what we’re focused on: 

🔋 Doubling Energy Efficiency: We can’t build enough renewables fast enough if we don’t first make the system more efficient. Doubling energy efficiency could cut emissions substantially, unlocking trillions in savings and making clean energy growth achievable. 

💰 Scaling Blended Finance: RMI advocates for blending public and private funds to drive climate investment where it’s needed most — especially in the Global South. The G20 is already setting the stage for this, and we’re urging COP29 to catalyze unprecedented financial flows for global climate action. 

📉  Curbing Methane: Methane is 80x more potent than CO2 in warming the planet, so cuts deliver immediate climate benefits. RMI partners with satellite and sensor tech to spotlight methane leaks and advocates for embedding methane targets into national climate plans. 

🏗️ Green Iron Corridors: The future of steelmaking is clean hydrogen and renewables. By supporting green iron and steel production, we can lower emissions in heavy industry and build new opportunities for regions rich in iron and clean energy potential. 

Join us in championing a fair and rapid transition for all.

At #ClimateWeekNYC, RMI convened leaders from Amazon, Netflix, and Ripple to discuss how private sector action is critical to achieving clean energy goals. From entertainment companies to industrial manufacturers, our corporate partners are scaling innovative energy solutions that reduce emissions and accelerate the energy transition. 

Big corporations’ climate actions can deliver outsized impacts as they replicate up and down their supply chains. “We've got willing suppliers who want to move towards low-carbon solutions. We have willing buyers who understand that there is a cost curve [for] with new technologies, and they're willing lead in this space. We've got to match those up better.” — @Chris Atkins, Amazon Worldwide Operations Sustainability

But first, we have to find where methane is being released.

New satellites and monitoring tools and technologies from RMI Environmental Defense Fund, Carbon Mapper, and more are making it clearer than ever where methane is being released worldwide. With this improved transparency, decision-makers can target their methane reduction strategies to the places where they are needed most.

“We've finally gotten to the space where we understand fundamentally that things that are invisible can harm us -- and it held us back for a really long time. That's where I think the satellite data is going to be absolutely transformational, because methane isn’t invisible anymore. [...] That's really going to open up minds and doors and decisions all over -- financial, actors, governments, industry, all over the place,” said RMI’s Deborah Gordon during our #ClimateWeekNYC event today on efforts to reduce methane from the oil and gas sector.

We’re about to make a big leap forward as we shift from fossil fuels to clean energy like solar, wind, and electric tech — almost doubling global energy efficiency in the process! 

🛑 The Issue:
Most of our energy supply today comes from burning fuels like coal and gas. Thisis great to produce heat but inefficient when we need electricity — about two-thirds of the original energy is wasted.  

Our modern world increasingly runs on electricity, not heat. This mismatch between supply and demand wastes an enormous amount of energy. 

⚡ The Solution: Renewables generate electricity directly, skipping the waste and making the energy system much more efficient. 

💥 Big Changes Ahead: Switching to renewables will lead to a huge boost in energy productivity, finally giving us the efficient energy we need for a cleaner, smarter future! We saw that after World War 2 when more efficient oil and gas replaced coal and biomass. We will see it again in the coming decades.

Beginning in early March of this year, a combination of solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower has consistently generated more than 100% of the state's electricity demand for part of nearly every day.

On some afternoons, solar panels alone have produced more power than the state consumes.

At night, large utility-scale batteries installed over the past few years become the grid’s largest power source, redistributing stored energy to consumers.

California, boasting the fifth-largest economy in the world, has demonstrated that a thriving modern economy can indeed run on clean energy.

However, California's achievement is not an isolated success. According to our most recent insights, the world might reach peak fossil-fuel use this year, driven by a surge in renewable energy. 👏

In the past decade, cleantech costs have fallen by up to 80 percent, while investment is up nearly tenfold, and solar generation has risen twelvefold. Electricity has become the largest source of useful energy, and the deep force of efficiency has reduced energy demand by a fifth.

Half of the worldwide growth in cleantech is from China, but exponential growth is also happening across the OECD (rich countries) and in the Global South as Asia electrifies. By 2030, we will be installing 1,000 GW of solar a year and selling 6,000 GWh of batteries a year, making possible the COP goal of tripling renewable capacity.

This is the pivotal decade. When falling cleantech costs become financially irresistible, renewable capacity expands, and fossil fuel demand reaches the end of its plateau, the Paris Agreement could be within reach. The direction of change is inevitable, but the speed is up to us. Now is the time to act. https://bit.ly/4eBtsH0

In the United States, approximately 18 million people live within two kilometers of an oil and gas well. Flares and their associated emissions are known to have negative health impacts and to form smog, which is linked to cardiovascular, nervous system, and reproductive health issues.

RMI’s Oil Climate Index plus Gas (OCI+) web tool analyzes the wide-ranging climate impacts of oil and gas production. Now, the Flaring EJ Risk Map, a new environmental justice risk feature, has been added to consider the underlying demographics in the vicinity of flares so that decision-makers can better protect public health and the environment, especially for vulnerable populations. https://bit.ly/4b5TTlK

“This framework is a call to action, especially in sectors that are critical to our economies,” said RMI’s CEO Jon Creyts, “Today is pivotal… this framework is not just another initiative. It is a vital tool to bring the aluminum industry in line with climate goals.” 👏

Let’s uncover some facts… 
🔍 Fact 1: Natural gas has been considered a climate-friendly alternative to coal, but it’s time to reassess. Methane releases from leaks and intentional venting in the gas supply chain raise serious concerns about its climate safety credentials.

🌬️ Fact 2: Methane, a major component of natural gas, is over 80 times more potent than CO2 as a climate pollutant. Tackling methane emissions can deliver significant reductions and make a real impact on the climate crisis.

💡 Fact 3: Cutting methane emissions is a low-hanging fruit compared to complex strategies for reducing CO2. Minimizing methane leakage would be equivalent to taking all US cars off the road for a year. It's a tangible and cost-effective step.

The good news? Emissions transparency throughout oil and natural gas supply chains can help policymakers and industry leaders act on specific interventions and emissions reduction solutions to stop methane leakage and wasted gas ASAP.

The Global South (here defined as Latin America, Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia) possesses 70% of the world’s renewable potential. RMI's latest report discusses how these areas are tapping into their renewable resources in record amounts 💡

“If you’d asked me a month ago who was deploying renewables faster – the Global South or the Global North – I would have thought it safe to say the Global North,” says RMI’s Vikram Singh, senior principal in the Global South program, “but we dive into the data and find a different and surprising reality: the Global South is scaling solar and wind faster than the Global North.”

In 2024, 87% of financial investments in electricity generation across the Global South is projected to go toward clean energy projects—a significant increase from five years ago that represents truly vast potential.

Barriers can include high up-front capital costs to scale new technology, uncertain revenue streams for first-of-a-kind projects, political and currency risks in emerging markets, or simply returns that are too low or long-term for purely commercial investors.  

The United States — in partnership with allies and multilateral banks — can support projects to unlock private capital in a way that prioritizes strategic geographies and technologies, diversifies supply chains, and expands markets for US companies. By doing so, the US can not only advance national security, but it can also strengthen strategic supply chains for essential raw materials and help mobilize private investment into critical clean energy projects — especially in emerging markets and frontier technologies.

But why does methane leak, when are companies not aware, how can we spot it, and how can we fix the problem? 

Methane leaks from many different places, including faulty equipment, pressure changes underground, and from old, barely-producing marginal and abandoned wells. While some of these leaks are small, others can be huge causing a whopping 66 percent of the gas produced to be thrown away. The good news is that solutions, like equipment replacement, routine monitoring, open certification, and buyers' prioritizing the procurement of low-leakage gas, can stop leakage and cut methane waste. 

At #CERAWeek, energy solutions across the board were discussed, including how oil and gas can aid in the energy transition.

Thankfully, there are proven, cost-effective strategies to reduce and recycle organic waste and strengthen emission controls at disposal sites that could curb nearly 90 percent of methane emissions from solid waste.  

More than 30 countries at #COP29 signed on to set specific targets to reduce waste sector methane and develop new policies and programs to achieve those targets. Focusing on the waste sector is essential to achieve the Global Methane Pledge’s goal to cut methane by 30% below 2020 levels, by 2030, limit near-term temperature rise, and avoid dangerous climate tipping points.

The $125-million partnership between IDB Invest and Engie Energia Chile has established a model financial mechanism that links interest rate reductions to early coal plant retirement while also funding renewable development. 

The structure's efficacy has been validated through real results. Multiple generating units at the Tocopilla thermal facility have ceased operations ahead of their scheduled retirement date, while a 151-megawatt wind generation facility in Calama progresses toward commissioning.  

This successful implementation can be attributed to several critical enabling conditions: Chile's comprehensive policy framework supporting coal phase-out initiatives; definitive demand signals from industrial electricity consumers; strategic deployment of blended finance by development institutions; and the increasingly favorable economics of renewable energy generation. 

Chile’s progress extends beyond this deal. In 2019, they decided to phase out coal. At the time, the South American country had 28 coal-fired power plants. At #COP29 on Friday, Chilean Minister of Environment Maisa Rojas provided a status update on a panel moderated by RMI’s Brian  O'Hanlon and hosted by The Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA): Chile has closed 11 coal-fired power plants and there are 9 more available for closing or retrofitting by 2026.

And green hydrogen provides a viable pathway to achieve near-zero emissions in the ironmaking process.  

Globally, steel supply chains are dependent on key regions that supply iron ore. That’s why iron and steel are usually produced in the same integrated facilities, near access to cheap coal.  

When iron ore reserves are co-located with renewable energy resources, a higher value green hydrogen-based iron product can be produced. This presents the opportunity to physically separate the making of steel from the production of iron to establish Green Iron Corridors. The production of green iron can instead take place in areas with ample renewables, to make clean hydrogen. Transporting that green iron to existing steel centers can help steelmaking remain where demand is strong. 

At #COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, RMI brought together representatives from various geographies across the supply chain — iron ore miners, renewable energy, and hydrogen developers, financiers, and government officials — to explore the emerging production and trade dynamics for Green Iron Corridors and identify action items to make them a reality.

The maritime sector sits at the center of the global economy – more than 80% of world trade travels by sea – and is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many shipping companies are taking action to reduce their emissions, but it can be challenging to find customers willing to pay for the higher cost of clean shipping fuels.  

Katalist helps bridge this gap by separating the low-emissions product from its sustainability benefits and transferring them to another party through a registry, enabling customers to claim the environmental benefits of low-emissions transport without physically receiving it, while stimulating overall use of clean fuels.  

Freight customers willing to pay a green premium for low-emission transport services can reliably use Katalist to achieve their decarbonization goals. And ship operators using low-emission fuels can use it to access a broader market of freight customers willing to pay an environmental supplement. The registry will help drive investments in lower-emission fuels, boosting their cost-competitiveness and commercial availability.

As COP29 unfolds in Baku, RMI is set to push for transformative action on the world’s most pressing climate challenges. This year’s “finance COP” is a pivotal moment to prioritize the Global South with commitments to extend climate finance, reduce wasteful energy use, and slash methane emissions. Here’s what we’re focused on: 

🔋 Doubling Energy Efficiency: We can’t build enough renewables fast enough if we don’t first make the system more efficient. Doubling energy efficiency could cut emissions substantially, unlocking trillions in savings and making clean energy growth achievable. 

💰 Scaling Blended Finance: RMI advocates for blending public and private funds to drive climate investment where it’s needed most — especially in the Global South. The G20 is already setting the stage for this, and we’re urging COP29 to catalyze unprecedented financial flows for global climate action. 

📉  Curbing Methane: Methane is 80x more potent than CO2 in warming the planet, so cuts deliver immediate climate benefits. RMI partners with satellite and sensor tech to spotlight methane leaks and advocates for embedding methane targets into national climate plans. 

🏗️ Green Iron Corridors: The future of steelmaking is clean hydrogen and renewables. By supporting green iron and steel production, we can lower emissions in heavy industry and build new opportunities for regions rich in iron and clean energy potential. 

Join us in championing a fair and rapid transition for all.

Technologies exist that can significantly reduce emissions in these sectors. However, scaling up these alternatives is expensive and requires high upfront investments, tightening supply, and driving up prices for buyers. Enter demand aggregation. 

Demand aggregation can help overcome these barriers by consolidating demand from multiple individual buyers into a single, larger signal. This helps de-risk new markets for buyers, producers and their financiers, kickstarting new, low-emissions supply chains. Together, climate-ambitious consumers can send strong demand signals for low-emissions products and aid suppliers in attracting investment to scale rapidly.

We’re about to make a big leap forward as we shift from fossil fuels to clean energy like solar, wind, and electric tech — almost doubling global energy efficiency in the process! 

🛑 The Issue:
Most of our energy supply today comes from burning fuels like coal and gas. Thisis great to produce heat but inefficient when we need electricity — about two-thirds of the original energy is wasted.  

Our modern world increasingly runs on electricity, not heat. This mismatch between supply and demand wastes an enormous amount of energy. 

⚡ The Solution: Renewables generate electricity directly, skipping the waste and making the energy system much more efficient. 

💥 Big Changes Ahead: Switching to renewables will lead to a huge boost in energy productivity, finally giving us the efficient energy we need for a cleaner, smarter future! We saw that after World War 2 when more efficient oil and gas replaced coal and biomass. We will see it again in the coming decades.

Beginning in early March of this year, a combination of solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower has consistently generated more than 100% of the state's electricity demand for part of nearly every day.

On some afternoons, solar panels alone have produced more power than the state consumes.

At night, large utility-scale batteries installed over the past few years become the grid’s largest power source, redistributing stored energy to consumers.

California, boasting the fifth-largest economy in the world, has demonstrated that a thriving modern economy can indeed run on clean energy.

However, California's achievement is not an isolated success. According to our most recent insights, the world might reach peak fossil-fuel use this year, driven by a surge in renewable energy. 👏

Let’s uncover some facts… 
🔍 Fact 1: Natural gas has been seen as a climate-friendly alternative to coal, but it’s time to reassess. Methane releases from leaks and intentional venting in the gas supply chain raise serious concerns about its climate safety credentials.

🌬️ Fact 2: Methane, a major component of natural gas, is over 80 times more potent than CO2 as a climate pollutant. Tackling methane emissions can deliver significant reductions and make a real impact on the climate crisis.

💡 Fact 3: Cutting methane emissions is a low-hanging fruit compared to complex strategies for reducing CO2. Minimizing methane leakage would be equivalent to taking all US cars off the road for a year. It's a tangible and cost-effective step.

The good news? Emissions transparency throughout oil and natural gas supply chains can help policymakers and industry leaders act on specific interventions and emissions reduction solutions to stop methane leakage and wasted gas ASAP.
