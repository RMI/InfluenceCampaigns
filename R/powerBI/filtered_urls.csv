"https://third-derivative.org/the-ev-battery-supply-chain-explained/ GM also has a legacy of hesitance to adapt, making them have a lower brand reputation than Tesla. With innovation and a change of management, there could be light at the end of the tunnel if GM invests or collaborates with high tech companies, therefore gaining an environment built on support of risk-taking and innovation. GM is also known for the unsuccessful brand image. As a result, the company has experienced arduous efforts gaining customers for their EVs. On the other hand, if GM were to capitalize their image it would emphasize performance and dependability, benefiting their EVs. Reports show that the recognition for Tesla has acquired customers to pay more for their premium automobiles rather than competitors EV’s"
